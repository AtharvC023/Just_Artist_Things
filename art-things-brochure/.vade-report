export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" suppressHydrationWarning>
      <body className={`${inter.className} antialiased ${lora.variable}`}>
        <ThemeProvider
          attribute="class"
          defaultTheme="system"
          enableSystem
          disableTransitionOnChange
        >
          {children}

        </ThemeProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

## Verification Steps Completed
